In order to resolve the merge conflict, we need to see the content of the conflict in the file `app/dependencies.py`. 

However, based on the described situation, you would need to integrate the changes from the blue print repo related to the Authentication feature into the target repository without changing or removing any existing functionality in the target repository.

Here is a general guide on how to resolve merge conflicts:

1. Open the conflicted file `app/dependencies.py` in a text editor.
2. Search for the conflict markers "<<<<<<<", "=======", and ">>>>>>>". Everything between "<<<<<<<" and "=======" is your local changes (target repository), and everything between "=======" and ">>>>>>>" is the incoming changes (blue print repo).
3. Compare the two sections and decide whether to keep only your changes, only the incoming changes, or a combination of the two. In this case, you should keep all the existing content (local changes) and add the Authentication feature from the incoming changes.
4. Once you've finished resolving all the conflicts in the file, save the file.
5. Run `git add app/dependencies.py` to stage the resolved file.
6. Run `git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in app/dependencies.py"` to commit the resolved file.
7. Finally, push the changes to the remote repository.

For the final pull request, you could write something like this:

"Added Authentication feature from blue print repository to our service. All existing functionality has been maintained, with the new Authentication feature integrated in a compatible manner."

Here is a JSON object for the git commands:

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "command": "git add app/dependencies.py",
      "description": "Stage the resolved file"
    },
    {
      "command": "git commit -m \"Resolved merge conflict in app/dependencies.py\"",
      "description": "Commit the resolved file"
    },
    {
      "command": "git push origin <branch-name>",
      "description": "Push the changes to the remote repository"
    }
  ]
}
```
