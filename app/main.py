from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from .dependencies import get_db
```

2. Message for the Pull request:
```markdown
This merge request adds the new feature for Authentication from the base repository (blue print repo) to the target repository. 

It was necessary to resolve a merge conflict in the file `app/main.py` wherein both the base and the target repo had changes that affected the same lines. The conflict was resolved by retaining the functionality of both repositories. The authentication feature from the base repo was added without removing or changing the existing functionality of the target repo.
```
