The following steps will resolve the merge conflict:

1. Edit the conflicting file to manually merge the changes. The resolved `README.md` file should look like this:

```markdown
### Service Management

`GET /status`

Get the status of the API.

### Package Management

`POST /packages/`

Create a new package. Requires a unique package ID and an optional description.

`GET /packages/{package_id}`

Retrieve tracking information for a specific package.

### System Management

`GET /status`

Get the status of the API.

### User Management

`POST /token`

Obtain an access token.

`GET /users/me`

Retrieve the current user's details.
```

2. Now, we can add these changes to the staging area, commit and push the changes to the repository.

Here is the task list for the git commands as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "command": "git add README.md",
      "description": "Adds the resolved file to the staging area."
    },
    {
      "command": "git commit -m 'Resolved merge conflict in README.md'",
      "description": "Commits the changes to the repository with a message."
    },
    {
      "command": "git push origin branch-name",
      "description": "Pushes the changes to the remote repository."
    }
  ]
}
```

3. The pull request can be created with the following message:

```markdown
This pull request resolves a merge conflict in the README.md file. The conflict arose from trying to merge changes from the blueprint repository, which involved adding a new authentication feature, into the target repository. The merge conflict has been resolved by incorporating all the changes from both the repositories without removing any existing content or functionality. This ensures that the target repository now has the new authentication feature along with its existing content and functionality. 
```
